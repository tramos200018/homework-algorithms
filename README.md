# Assignment 11 - Block Stacking

## The Files

My implementation has three files. BlockRep is the file that represents a block. It takes in the dimensions of the block and also determines the base area of the block. The OutputText file takes in the list of blocks and prints out the height of the tallest possible tower as well as printing out the actual tower itself. This file uses a DP solution in order to find the height of the tallest possible tower. The Block file is main file that takes in the input file and prints out the height of the tallest possible tower using the given blocks. 

First the program will ask to enter an input file. After entering the desired file, it will print out the height of the tallest possible tower and the tower itself.
